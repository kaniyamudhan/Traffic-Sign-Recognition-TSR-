# Road Sign Recognition App

## Overview

This is a PyQt5 application for road sign recognition. It uses a trained model to classify road signs based on images provided by the user.

## Features

- Browse and load an image for classification.
- Classify the loaded image and display the recognized class.
- Train the model using a convolutional neural network (CNN).
- Display training accuracy and loss graphs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Keras
- scikit-learn
- numpy
- matplotlib
- pyttsx3
- Pillow (PIL)
