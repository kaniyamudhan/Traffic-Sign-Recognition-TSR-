# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-TSR-

📚 Imports: The necessary libraries and modules are imported, setting the foundation for the project.

🖼️ Data Loading and Preprocessing: Road sign images are loaded, resized, and prepared for training and testing. The data is split into training and testing sets.

🎨 GUI Setup: The graphical user interface is created using PyQt5, complete with buttons for image browsing, classification, and training. Each button triggers specific actions when clicked.

📂 Image Loading: The "Browse Image" button allows users to select an image, which is then displayed on the GUI for further processing.

🔍 Image Classification: The "Classify" button loads a pre-trained CNN model to predict the road sign in the selected image. The recognized sign is displayed and spoken using text-to-speech.

🧠 Model Training: The "Training" button triggers the creation and training of a new CNN model using the loaded dataset. The training progress is visualized with accuracy and loss plots, and the trained model is saved for future use.

🚀 GUI Initialization and Event Handling: The PyQt application is initialized, and the GUI components are set up. The application is ready to respond to user interactions.

This breakdown showcases the different stages of the code using fun emojis! 😊
